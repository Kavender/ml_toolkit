# ML ToolKit Readme

### Overview

Over years of ML/DL practice, there are tons of codes being produced with similar functionality. For instance, how we analyze data during data exploration and training a classifier (w or w/o pretrained models). 

To save future code development and learn at my own pace, I started to collect and summarize the popular utility functions or type of analysis into bite-size code.


### Disclaimer
Currently, the code is not fully developed and requires both doctest and unit tests to support. 
The goal is to keep expanding my toolkit and make it robust and up-to-date.


### What to expect
SckitTrainer: A base trainer that support both scikit-learn and DL training.
